# EEG_Emotion_detection
An EEG emotion detection project involves the use of EEG signals to determine a person's emotional state.
EEG stands for Electroencephalogram, which is a technique used to record electrical activity in the brain.

EEG emotion detection aims to use EEG signals to determine a person's emotional state.

There are different approaches to EEG emotion detection, including time-domain analysis, frequency-domain analysis, and machine learning-based analysis.

EEG emotion detection can be useful in various applications, such as mental health diagnosis, human-computer interaction, and affective computing.

EEG emotion detection requires a high-quality EEG recording setup, including electrodes, amplifiers, and software for signal processing and analysis.

EEG emotion detection research is ongoing, and there are still challenges to be addressed, such as individual variability in brain signals and the need for more extensive datasets.

EEG emotion detection has the potential to advance our understanding of the neural basis of emotions and contribute to the development of more effective interventions for emotional disorders.

This project was done during my 6th semester as a Mini project.
